# Text Based Adventure Game


# Premise
This is a simple text-based endless RPG-style adventure game that works
with user inputs.

There is no story and the objective is to summon the final boss and defeat them.
This is done through the use of summoning items which can be obtained throughout
the course of the game.

The user will traverse a maze with several rooms. Each room will contain a
random event such as a monster to fight or a store to stock up on items. The
player's decisions will have an impact on what challenges are presented and
their difficulty as well.

# Building
To build the project, currently, compile the main file (`main.cc`). This project
is mean to be built on `C++23` so do not forget to specify `-std=c++23`. This
project will migrate to CMake soon. Bash and BAT scripts will be provided, too.

# How-To
For each room, you will be presented with a set of options. Enter the letter or number associated with the option. There will also be a set of options that you can access at any time available atop all the room-specific options.
